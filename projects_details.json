    "title": "Smart Pill Dispenser — STM32-Based Medication Management System",
    "year": "2024",
    "role": "Embedded Firmware Developer | Microcontroller Systems",

    "overview": "An STM32-based smart pill dispenser for home-care medication routines. After one-time setup, it automatically dispenses at scheduled times and helps caregivers track whether dispensing happened.",
    "overviewPoints": [
      "One-time schedule setup (supports multiple dispensing times per day).",
      "RFID-controlled access for authorised users.",
      "RTC timekeeping for accurate scheduled dispensing.",
      "Servo-driven dispensing with a 3D-printed guiding mechanism.",
      "IR/PIR sensing to confirm dispensing activity and detect presence.",
      "OLED + keypad for setup and status."
    ],

    "summary": "A smart pill dispenser built on an STM32 that helps patients take the correct medication on time. It automates dispensing based on a schedule and makes it easier for caregivers to manage daily medication routines.",

    "problem": "Some patients (especially elderly users) may forget to take medication or accidentally take it twice when relying on memory or manual pill boxes. In home-care settings, caregivers can also misread the schedule or give a dose at the wrong time, especially when managing multiple medications and busy routines.",

    "solution": "The device uses RFID for authorised access, an RTC to keep time and run scheduled dispensing, and a servo mechanism with sensors to dispense pills and confirm activity at the scheduled time.",

    "targetUsers": "Elderly patients taking multiple medications, and caregivers/healthcare workers who need a simple way to support medication adherence.",

    "impact": "The prototype improved consistency of scheduled dispensing during testing and helped caregivers check whether dispensing happened as planned.",

    "tech": "STM32, Embedded C++, RFID, RTC, IR Sensor, PIR Sensor, Servo Motor, OLED Display, Keypad",

    "responsibilities": [
      "Developed STM32 firmware in C++ to control the full system.",
      "Integrated RFID authentication, RTC scheduling, sensors (IR/PIR), and servo motor control.",
      "Configured STM32 peripherals such as GPIO, timers, and interrupts for real-time behaviour.",
      "Troubleshot firmware logic and electrical wire connections (power, signal, grounding) to stabilise sensor readings and servo operation.",
      "Worked with teammates to test and verify the prototype end-to-end."
    ],

    "features": [
      "RFID authentication for controlled access.",
      "RTC-based scheduling (one-time setup) for automatic dispensing at configured times.",
      "3D-printed housing and custom dispensing parts to guide pills and support the mechanism.",
      "Servo-driven dispensing mechanism to release pills on schedule.",
      "Sensors (IR/PIR) to detect dispensing activity and user presence.",
      "OLED + keypad for setup, status display, and on-device configuration."
