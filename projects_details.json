      "content": "The Smart Pill Dispenser was focused on improving medication management in both hospital and home-care environments. It addresses common medication errors caused by forgetfulness, manual scheduling, and human oversight, especially among elderly users and busy healthcare staff. The system is built using an STM32 microcontroller and automates pill dispensing at scheduled times while confirming dispensing activity through sensors."

    {
      "type": "text",
      "title": "Problem",
      "content": "Many patients, particularly elderly users, forget to take medication or accidentally take it more than once. In hospital settings, manual medication handling increases staff workload and raises the risk of missed or incorrect doses during busy routines."
    },
{
  "type": "text",
  "title": "Solution",
  "content": "The system automates medication dispensing by releasing pills at predefined times and verifying the dispensing process using sensors. This reduces reliance on memory and manual handling, improving medication safety and consistency. In normal mode, the dispenser runs its scheduled cycles automatically, while configuration mode (unlocked via RFID and keypad input) is used by authorised staff to adjust or update medication timings before returning to normal operation."

Product information, user/cart data, and orders are stored and managed in a MariaDB database. For online pickup orders, the system generates a QR code containing an Order ID to enable fast in-store pickup verification. Power management logic was implemented to reduce energy consumption by dynamically switching between low and high power operating modes."

The scanning workflow includes continuous item verification against the product database, followed by cart total calculation and checkout confirmation. Optional membership authentication is performed using RFID, extending the payment process with additional validation steps.\n\nOnline customers interact with the system through a website to browse products, add items to the cart, and complete checkout remotely. The website communicates with a MariaDB database to retrieve product details and store cart/order information. For online pickup purchases, the system generates a QR code containing an Order ID, which is scanned during in-store pickup for verification. The payment gateway supports payment methods such as ATM card, PayWave/RFID, and Visa, while backend services handle authentication, item validation, and order summary generation."

A camera module connected via the CSI port performs barcode scanning for item identification. An RFID reader interfaced through GPIO and SPI pins enables membership authentication, while a keypad connected to GPIO pins allows user input for menu navigation and checkout control.\n\nAn ultrasonic sensor connected to GPIO pins is used to detect object presence and system interaction states. Output devices include an LCD connected through the I2C interface for displaying menus, item details, and payment information, as well as a buzzer connected to a GPIO pin to provide audio feedback during authentication and system events. This modular hardware design ensures reliable real-time interaction between sensors, user interfaces, and backend software components."
