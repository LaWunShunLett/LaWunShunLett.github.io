  "title": "Smart Pill Dispenser — STM32-Based Medication Management System",
  "year": "2024",
  "role": "Embedded Firmware Developer | Microcontroller Systems",

  "summary": "A smart pill dispenser that helps patients take the correct medication at the right time, built on an STM32 microcontroller with sensors and motors that automatically dispense pills according to a timing schedule.",

  "problem": "Patients, especially elderly users, can miss or double-take medication doses when they rely on manual pill organisers or memory alone.",

  "solution": "The dispenser authenticates staff via RFID, schedules doses using an RTC, and uses a servo-driven mechanism plus sensors to release and verify the correct medication at each scheduled time.",

  "targetUsers": "Elderly patients on multiple medications and caregivers who need a reliable way to track adherence.",

  "impact": "Improved dosing reliability during prototype tests and gave caregivers clearer visibility into whether doses were dispensed and retrieved on time.",

  "tech": "STM32, Embedded C++, RFID, RTC, IR Sensor, PIR Sensor, Servo Motor, OLED Display, Keypad",

  "responsibilities": [
    "Developed the C++ firmware for the STM32, integrating sensors, motors, and system control logic.",
    "Implemented RFID access control, RTC-based scheduling, IR/PIR detection, and servo actuation modules.",
    "Configured STM32 peripherals, sensor inputs, interrupts, and timing functions.",
    "Performed end-to-end troubleshooting of sensor readings, motor movement, timing accuracy, and firmware behaviour.",
    "Collaborated with teammates to validate system operation across hardware and firmware components."
  ],

  "features": [
    "RFID authentication for secure staff access.",
    "Real-Time Clock (RTC) for scheduled dispensing.",
    "IR and motion sensors to verify pill release and detect user presence.",
    "Servo-based pill dispensing mechanism.",
    "OLED display with keypad for configuration and status."
  ],

  "learnings": [
    "Building an embedded system from concept to working prototype.",
    "Writing embedded C++ for STM32 and integrating multiple sensors and actuators.",
    "Configuring microcontroller peripherals and interrupts for real-time behaviour.",
    "Debugging timing faults, signal noise, and mechanical alignment issues.",
    "Testing and validating a complete embedded hardware–software system."

    "problem": "Conventional manned checkout counters create queues and require more staff during peak hours.",
    "solution": "Built a kiosk that lets customers scan items, manage their cart locally, then sync to a web backend for payment and receipt.",
    "responsibilities": [
      "Maintained the Dockerised backend and database.",
      "Monitored Raspberry Pi kiosk health and performed on-site troubleshooting.",
      "Coordinated integration testing between kiosk and web interfaces."
